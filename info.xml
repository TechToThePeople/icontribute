  <name>Remove the banner asking to contribute on civicrm dashboard</name>
  <description>
By installing this extension, you promise me you either
- have contributed financially to civicrm sustainability
- or know that you might be hurting the project and have read the following:

So it turns out that developers are human being that need to be fed. The usual way is to have some kind of exchange between money and work, but there is a lot of work on civi to improve perfomance, move to more modern framework, security audit, bug huting, testing... all the cleaning tasks that needs to be done, but that are not "shiny new features" that are more likely to find sponsors.

We are trying to widen our Financial Support Base, directly on the dashboard. This extension removes this ability to ask, so might decrease our ability to get.
